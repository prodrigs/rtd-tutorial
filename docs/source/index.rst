Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API. It is actually quite fun! And a source of never-ending amusement!

Now, let's step into a far more serious business and try to typeset some interesting math.
Inlined, it will look like :math:`\sin(\theta)^2 + \cos(\theta)^2 = 1`, which is not that bad. On the
other hand, one may also have it displayed by its own as in

.. math::

   \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}, \quad \partial_t \mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{E},

   \nabla p = \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}, \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0, \frac{d}{dt} \rho p^\gamma = 0

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
